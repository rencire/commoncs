# Algorithm Adapted from Skiena 2008

# Kruskal(G)
#   Put edges in Priority Queue ordered by weight
#   count = 0
#   While (count < n -1))
#       get next edge (v,w)
#       if (component(v) != component(w))
#           Add edge to tree
#           merge component(v) and component(w)
#           count = count + 1
