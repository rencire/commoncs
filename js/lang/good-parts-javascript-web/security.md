# Principles

Deterrence is not effective
- you can't punish an invisible attacker.
- prevention is the only effective mechanism.

Kerckhoffs Principle
  - The design of a system should not require secrecy; and compromise of the system should not inconvenience the correspondents.


There is no security in obscurity
- The more secrets you have, the harder they are to keep.


- One-time pad
    - truly unbreakable
    - key must always remain secret
    - key must be at least as long as the plain text
    - cipher text is obtained by xor of the plain text and the key
    - key must be perfectly random
    - Key must never be used more than once!


Cryptography is not security

Security must be factored into every decision

"We'll go back and make it secure later."

You can't add security, just as you can't add reliability.
- Insecurity and unreliability must be removed.

Having survived to this point does not guarantee future survival.


The Impossible is not Possible.
- If a measure is not effective, it is ineffective.


Don't prohibit what you can't prevent.
- What you don't prevent, you allow.

False security is worse than no security
- Unecessary expense and confusion of risk.
